# PP-exercise-5
Exercise 5 from The Pragmatic Programmer.

"We want to implement a mini-language to control a simple drawing package (perhaps a turtle-graphics system). The language consists of single-letter commands. Some commands are followed by a single number. For example, the following input would draw a rectangle.

P 2 # select pen 2
D   # pen down
W 2 # draw west 2 cm
N 1 # then north 1 cm
E 2 # then east 2 cm
S 1 # then back south
U   # pen up

Implement the code that parses the language. It should be designed so that it is simple to add new commands."
